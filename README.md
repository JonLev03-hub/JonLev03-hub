 My name is Jonathan, I'm a up and coming datascientist with a background in game development and mathmatics.
                        To perform datascience I have learned Python, C, Javascript, SQL, and HTML, and have gainedfield specific knowledge 
                        from personal projects and training with Butler Universities Data Science bootcamp. With my skills in multiple programming languages
                        , problem solving, and chart visualization I am able to effectively do data analysis and show results to a large audience. I'd love if
                        you had a look at some of my work displayed in my portfolio!
