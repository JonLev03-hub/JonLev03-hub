- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JonLev03-hub


Im currently studying Data Science through a bootcamp at butler. I have always been interusted in coding, starting in middleschool making small games with the unity, and now im looking to find a career in the datascience field after I get more experience. I love working with stock and finance data, and would love to create financial tools in the future. I mostly work with python but hope to expand my knowledge so I will be able to perform tasks more effectively.
