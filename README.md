My name is Jonathan, I'm an up-and-coming software engineer with a background in data analytics and mathematics. I love to build a responsive and interactive website and am currently learning how to improve my skills to work with back-end development. My interest in programming began in Highschool when I took many computer science courses.Â To further my experience I have also taken Butler University's data science certification program sharpening my skills in the field. Since that certification, I have been working on Freelance contracts and tailoring my skills to software engineering.
